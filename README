This repository contains the DFT relaxed crystal structures of lacunar spinels at different levels of exchange-correlation functionals.

The files are named as follows:
-- compound name
-- space group
-- DFT functional used 
-- (optional) if multiple magnetic moment configurations are found, the last term specifies the magnetic moment at convergence (e.g. mu5 means \mu = 5)
